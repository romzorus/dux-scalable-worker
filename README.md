# Dux : scalable worker implementation

# The goal
Instead of having one big automation tool (meaning configuration management or orchestration tool) trying to handle all scenarios (be scalable, performant, handle local and remote hosts through this protocol or this one, be compliant with this security standard and this one...), we prefer to build one flexible automation *engine* (the [duxcore](https://crates.io/crates/duxcore) crate) and make it as easy as possible to embed in a codebase already adapted to one's specific need.

This repository contains one implementation example : the scalable worker version. This binary fetches assignments from a [controller](https://gitlab.com/dux-tool/dux-scalable-controller) through a RabbitMQ instance, run them and send back the results still through RabbitMQ. The use of a message broker in between what generates assignments and what run them allows to scale the system.

# Todo list
- [ ] introduce end-to-end encryption [(Ockam ?)](https://github.com/build-trust/ockam)
- [ ] add unit tests and integration tests
- [ ] create Docker image to allow scaling it
